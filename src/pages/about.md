## nice to meet you!🐏
TL;DR:
- 📕 game developer / computational linguist
- ✏️ i mainly use C#, but work with many others
- 🎻 and make the music and art for most of my games
- 📒 you're reading my portfolio
- 🎮 [and here's my games!](https://rosehairedsheep.itch.io/)

### okay, but i wanna know more. who are you?
Alright! You can call me **caprisun** or **vivi**, and I'll even tell you my real name if you hire me! I am based in Finland and speak Czech and English fluently, and Finnish and German well enough.

I majored in Computational Linguistics from a German university in 2021, but have been disappointed with the nature of most job offerings in the field since then, so I turned to game dev. I've since worked both in teams and solo, and released a few games, all of which you can find through the link at the top of this page.

### would you still do compling given the right chance?
I would, yeah. There's a lot of good space in the field left to explore.

### what languages / tools do you know?
#### game engines
I am most familiar and comfortable with **Godot** (primarily 4 plus some experience with 3) using both GDScript and C#. I've also worked with **Unity** enough to know my way around it. Recently I have also been learning my way around **Butano**, although I doubt this is of professional interest to you (if it is, I'll pay to work for you, you're so cool).

#### programming languages
For most of my projects I use **C#**, but some of my Godot projects use **GDScript**. I also have decent experience with **Python** and **Java**, and I know plenty of **HTML**, **CSS** and some of **TypeScript**, the last three of which I used to make this website. If pressed, I could manage something with **C++** (currently learning this one!) or **R** (pretty rusty).

#### other tools
All of my pixel art has been made and animated with **Aseprite**, and I used either **Procreate** or **Krita** for the rest of my digital pieces. Music was done mainly through **BeepBox** and **Bandlab**, but I'm not fully satisfied with either, so I am currently looking for an alternative for future projects. I used **Astro** to make this portfolio, and **Jekyll** for the previous one.

I'm definitely not listing everything here though, so if you're curious, feel free to ask! Also, it feels silly to even mention, but I do indeed use **git**.

### what kinds of games interest you?
Quite a variety, I'd say. My favourite genres are **metroidvanias**, **roguelikes**, and **deckbuilders**, but I dearly enjoy many games outside of that scope. For some inexplicable reason I bear a great fondness for retro games and older consoles, especially in the **SNES**, **GBA**, and **DS**/**3DS** eras, even though I love a lot of current ones as well.

### you're cool! i wanna talk with you!
Thanks! You can send me an e-mail at **pinkhairedsheep@gmail.com**.
