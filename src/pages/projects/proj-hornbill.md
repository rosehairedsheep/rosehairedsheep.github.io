### about
An attempt at a smooth character controller with quality-of-life features and own animation controller. Honestly, this thing's pretty old, and I have since reimplemented most features from here in one way or another in other projects, but I still think this demo is worth showing off, if not just for the sake of seeing the beginnings.
