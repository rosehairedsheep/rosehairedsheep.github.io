### about
This thing that you're reading! A collection of my projects, arts, and blog posts.

### code
I used Astro to build the site and wrote the whole website from scratch without a template. There's a decent amount of TypeScript scattered in places, such as creating dynamic tag pages:

<img class="image" src="/media/projects/proj-portfolio/type_tags.png" />

The project, art, and blog pages are written with MDX, an expanded version of Markdown, which lets me insert custom elements into the page. I also have code for automatically pulling information out of the metadata of a Markdown page and creating sections based on those, such as the GitHub and table-of-contents elements either to your left or above, depending on which device you're using.

### ui
There's a bunch of CSS all around, of course. Also, I tried my best to make the website user-friendly to browse: the table-of-contents sections (not present in the arts and updates sections – yet!), tags being present in multiple places and always clickable, all that kind of fun stuff.
